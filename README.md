# Animal Farm

_This project is the first React project for Adem Mohammed on his journey to master React in a week._

### What can this app do?

It has a client and a server.  
- Client - React
    > Search for animals by animal type
- Server - Express 
    > API for random animals with the following format
```ts
type Animal {
    id: number;
    type: string;
    name: string;
    age: number;
}
```

### Future Recommendation
- Client  
    1. Use MUI, Component library to enhance the UI
